<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Welding Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Inert Protect Type</li><li>Semi-Inert Gas Protect Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Inert gas protected welding, also known as gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW), involves using an inert gas such as argon to shield the weld area from contamination by atmospheric gases. This method is commonly used for welding non-ferrous metals such as aluminum and copper. On the other hand, semi-inert gas protected welding, or gas metal arc welding (GMAW), utilizes a mixture of inert and active gases to protect the weld area. This method is suitable for welding ferrous metals like steel. Both types of welding are widely used in automotive manufacturing for their precision and strength.</p></p>
