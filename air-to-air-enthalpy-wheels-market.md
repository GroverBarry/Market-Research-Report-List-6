<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Air to Air Enthalpy Wheels Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Condensation Rotors</li><li>Hygroscopic Rotors</li><li>Sorption Rotors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Air to air enthalpy wheels are used in energy recovery systems to transfer heat and moisture between the supply and exhaust air streams. There are three main types of enthalpy wheels: condensation rotors, hygroscopic rotors, and sorption rotors. Condensation rotors utilize the condensation of moisture to transfer heat, hygroscopic rotors absorb and release moisture through their surface, and sorption rotors use a sorbent material to adsorb and desorb moisture. Each type of wheel has its own strengths and applications in HVAC systems.</p></p>
