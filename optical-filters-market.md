<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Optical Filters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Band-pass Optical Filter</li><li>High-pass Optical Filter</li><li>Low-pass Optical Filter</li><li>Band-stop Optical Filter</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Optical filters are categorized into four main types based on their functionalities. Band-pass optical filters allow a specific range of wavelengths to pass through while blocking others. High-pass optical filters only allow wavelengths above a certain cutoff point to pass. Low-pass optical filters, on the other hand, only let wavelengths below a certain cutoff point pass through. Band-stop optical filters, also known as notch filters, reject a specific range of wavelengths while allowing others to pass. These filters are essential in various industries such as photography, telecommunications, and spectroscopy.</p></p>
