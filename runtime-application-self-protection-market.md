<p><h1>Runtime Application Self-Protection Market Dynamics 2024-2031: Also about Its Market Trends, Projections, and Opportunities</h1></p><p><strong>Runtime Application Self-Protection Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP) is a security technology that is designed to detect and prevent security threats within applications at runtime. RASP works by embedding security controls directly into an application, which allows it to monitor and protect the application from attacks such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and others.</p><p>The Runtime Application Self-Protection Market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.3% during the forecast period. The increasing adoption of cloud-based applications and the growing number of cyber-attacks targeting applications are driving the demand for RASP solutions. Additionally, the stringent regulatory requirements for data protection and the rising need for real-time application security are contributing to the market growth.</p><p>One of the latest trends in the Runtime Application Self-Protection Market is the integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities into RASP solutions. This enables the solutions to continuously learn and adapt to new threats, providing more effective protection for applications. Another trend is the shift towards DevSecOps practices, where security is integrated into the development process from the start, including the use of RASP solutions to enhance application security.</p></p>
