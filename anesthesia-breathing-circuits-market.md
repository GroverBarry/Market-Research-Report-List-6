<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anesthesia Breathing Circuits Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Rebreathing Circuits</li><li>Rebreathing Circuits</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Anesthesia breathing circuits are used to deliver anesthetic gases to patients during surgery. Non-rebreathing circuits are commonly used for patients with lower tidal volumes, as they allow fresh gas to be delivered with minimal rebreathing of exhaled gases. Rebreathing circuits, on the other hand, are used for patients with higher tidal volumes, as they allow for some exhaled gases to be recirculated, reducing the amount of fresh gas needed. Both types of circuits play a crucial role in ensuring patient safety and comfort during anesthesia administration.</p></p>
