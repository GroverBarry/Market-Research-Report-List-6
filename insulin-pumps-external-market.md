<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Insulin Pumps (External) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Tethered pumps</li><li>Disposable/Patch pumps</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Insulin pumps are helpful devices for managing diabetes, with two main types on the market: tethered pumps and disposable/patch pumps. Tethered pumps are connected to the body by a tube and pump insulin continuously, while disposable/patch pumps are worn on the body and deliver insulin through a small cannula. Tethered pumps provide more control and flexibility in insulin delivery, while disposable/patch pumps offer convenience and discretion. Both types play crucial roles in effectively managing blood sugar levels for individuals with diabetes.</p></p>
