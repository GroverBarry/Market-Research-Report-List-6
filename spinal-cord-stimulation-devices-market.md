<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Spinal Cord Stimulation Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rechargeable SCS</li><li>Non-Rechargeable SCS</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) devices are divided into two main types: rechargeable SCS and non-rechargeable SCS. Rechargeable SCS devices allow for the battery to be recharged as needed, providing longer-term relief for patients without the need for frequent battery replacements. Non-rechargeable SCS devices, on the other hand, require the battery to be surgically replaced once it runs out. Both types of devices offer effective pain management for patients suffering from chronic conditions and are widely used in the healthcare industry.</p></p>
