<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Forging Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Closed Die Forgings</li><li>Open Die Forgings</li><li>Rolled Rings Forgings</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Closed die forgings, also known as impression die forgings, involve using two or more dies to shape the metal into a specific form. Open die forgings do not constrain the metal during deformation, allowing for a wider variety of shapes and sizes to be produced. Rolled rings forgings are created by shaping a metal preform into a seamless ring shape using specialized machinery. Each of these forging market types offers unique advantages and is suited for different applications based on the desired final product.</p></p>
