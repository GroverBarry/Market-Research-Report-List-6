<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gene Therapy for Mucopolysaccharidosis Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Intravenous</li><li>ICV</li><li>Intracerebral</li><li>Intracisternal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Gene therapy for Mucopolysaccharidosis can be delivered through various routes including intravenous, intracerebroventricular (ICV), intracerebral, and intracisternal. Intravenous delivery involves injecting the therapeutic gene directly into the bloodstream, allowing it to reach cells throughout the body. ICV delivery targets the cerebrospinal fluid, while intracerebral delivery targets specific regions of the brain. Intracisternal delivery involves injecting the gene therapy into the cisterna magna, a space in the brain near the spinal cord. Each method offers unique advantages and challenges in treating Mucopolysaccharidosis.</p></p>
