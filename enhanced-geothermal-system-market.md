<p><h1>Enhanced Geothermal System Market Growth, Market Trends, COVID-19 Impact, and Forecasts for period from 2024 - 2031</h1></p><p><strong>Enhanced Geothermal System Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>Enhanced Geothermal System (EGS) is a method of extracting geothermal energy from deep underground by injecting water into the hot rocks below the earth's surface, causing them to fracture and create pathways for the water to circulate and bring the heat back up to the surface in the form of steam to generate electricity. EGS has the potential to significantly increase the amount of geothermal energy that can be harnessed compared to traditional geothermal methods.</p><p>The Enhanced Geothermal System Market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 11.7% during the forecast period. Factors driving the growth of the market include increasing demand for renewable energy sources, government initiatives to promote geothermal energy development, and the advantages of EGS such as minimal greenhouse gas emissions and high energy production efficiency.</p><p>One of the latest trends in the Enhanced Geothermal System Market is the increasing investment in research and development to improve EGS technology and reduce costs. Companies are also focusing on expanding their geothermal power plant installations to meet the growing electricity demand worldwide. Additionally, collaborations between governments and private sector players to develop EGS projects are expected to drive market growth in the coming years.</p></p>
