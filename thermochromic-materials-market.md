<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thermochromic Materials Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Reversible Thermochromic Materials</li><li>Irreversible Thermochromic Materials</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Thermochromic materials are classified into two main types: reversible and irreversible. Reversible thermochromic materials change color temporarily when exposed to temperature changes, reverting back to their original color once cooled. These materials are commonly used in mood rings, baby bottles, and thermometers. On the other hand, irreversible thermochromic materials undergo a permanent color change when heated or cooled, making them ideal for applications like temperature indicators in packaging and safety labels. Both types offer unique properties for various industrial and consumer products.</p></p>
