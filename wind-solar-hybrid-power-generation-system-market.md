<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wind-solar Hybrid Power Generation System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>On-Grid System</li><li>Stand-Alone System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Wind-solar hybrid power generation systems can be classified into two main market types - on-grid system and stand-alone system. On-grid system refers to when the system is connected to the main electricity grid, allowing for surplus power to be sold back to the grid. Stand-alone system, on the other hand, is completely independent from the grid, providing power to remote areas or locations without access to electricity. Both systems utilize a combination of wind and solar energy to generate clean and sustainable power.</p></p>
