<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Optical Thickness Measurement System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact</li><li>Non-Contact</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Optical thickness measurement systems can be categorized into two main types: contact and non-contact. Contact systems involve physical contact between the measuring device and the surface being measured, typically using a probe or sensor. Non-contact systems, on the other hand, utilize optical technology such as lasers or cameras to measure thickness without touching the surface. Contact systems are ideal for precise measurements on delicate surfaces, while non-contact systems offer advantages in terms of speed and ease of use.</p></p>
