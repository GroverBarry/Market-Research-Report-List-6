<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Absorbable Suture Material Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Synthetic Material</li><li>Natural Material</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Absorbable suture material market can be classified into two main types: synthetic material and natural material. Synthetic materials are typically made from polymers such as polyglactin, polyglycolic acid, and polycaprolactone. They are broken down by the body over time and do not require removal. Natural materials, on the other hand, are derived from sources such as catgut or silk. These materials are also absorbable but may have different rates of absorption compared to synthetic materials. Both types of materials are widely used in surgical procedures for wound closure.</p></p>
