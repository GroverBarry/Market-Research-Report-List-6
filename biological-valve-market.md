<p><h1>Biological Valve Market Size, Share & Trends Analysis Report By Material, By Type, By End-user, By Region, And Segment Forecasts, 2024 - 2031</h1></p><p><strong>Biological Valve Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>A biological valve, also known as a tissue valve, is a type of heart valve that is made from animal tissue, usually from a pig, cow, or human donor. These valves are commonly used in cardiac surgery to replace damaged or diseased heart valves and are preferred by many patients due to their durability and biocompatibility.</p><p>The Biological Valve Market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 7.9% during the forecast period. This growth can be attributed to the increasing prevalence of heart diseases and the rising demand for minimally invasive surgical procedures. Additionally, technological advancements in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine are driving the development of more advanced biological valves with improved durability and longevity.</p><p>One of the latest trends in the Biological Valve Market is the increasing adoption of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) procedures. TAVR is a minimally invasive surgical technique that allows for the replacement of the aortic valve without the need for open-heart surgery. This approach is becoming increasingly popular among patients and healthcare providers due to its lower risk of complications and shorter recovery times. As a result, the demand for biological valves used in TAVR procedures is expected to grow significantly in the coming years.</p></p>
