<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Online Art Auction Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Reserved Auction</li><li>Unreserved Auction</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Online art auctions can be classified into two main market types: Reserved Auction and Unreserved Auction. In reserved auctions, the seller sets a minimum price for the artwork, and the bidding starts at that amount. On the other hand, unreserved auctions have no minimum price set by the seller, allowing the bidding to start at any amount. Reserved auctions provide a level of protection for the seller, ensuring that the artwork will not sell for less than its perceived value, while unreserved auctions allow for more dynamic bidding and potential for lower final prices.</p></p>
